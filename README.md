# Few-Shot-Prompting-for-Misogyny-and-Sexism-Detection-with-Large-Language-Models

## Abstract

With the rise of social media and traffic on these sites, where access can be fast and anonymous, hate speech, especially misogyny, has become a problem and detecting such comments are a growing challenge, especially in low-resource languages.
Although there are many approaches in high-resource languages which perform well, there is a lack of solutions in languages with little training data, such as German.
Therefore, the GermEval2024 GerMS-Detect competition was initiated to address this problem.
This work attempts to solve the problem of identifying misogyny and sexism using open source large language models and few-shot prompting.
Here we show that our model achieves a micro F1-score of 0.585 and a score of 0.637 in subtask 1 and 0.302 in subtask 2 in the open track and therefore takes first place within the competition.
The results show that our model delivers good results even without fine-tuning or a lot of training data.

*This work contains texts that are sexist and misogynistic. Such texts are unavoidable due to the nature of this work.*
